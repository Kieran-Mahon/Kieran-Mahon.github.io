            Hi, I'm Kieran Mahon. I am in my final year of study at AUT where I'm studying for a Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences.
            I am completing a double majoring in Software Development and Data Science.<br />I have been learning programming since I was in
            primary school where I started to learn JavaScript at Code Club Aotearoa. During high school I learnt Visual Basic, QB64, more of
            JavaScript, and Unity/C#. I used this knowledge to product projects and games for my assignments and for myself. During university
            I learnt Java, ASP.net (Razor Pages), PHP, HTML, and a bit of Python data programming. I have knowledge of the software development
            pipeline including which include knowledge of methodologies/tools such as Git/GitHub, Trello/Jira, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban. I have
            a strong passion of learning and programming.
