            Hi, I'm Kieran Mahon. I am in my final year of study at AUT where I'm studying for a Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences.
            I am completing a double majoring in Software Development and Data Science. With a focus on Software Development.<br />
            I have been learning programming since I was in primary school where I started to learn JavaScript at Code Club Aotearoa. During
            high school I learnt Visual Basic, QB64, more of JavaScript, and Unity/C#. I used this knowledge to produce projects and games for
            my assignments and for myself. During university I learnt Java, ASP.net (Razor Pages), PHP, HTML, a bit of Python data programming,
            forecasting, data models, data modelling, and text/vision intelligence. I have a strong knowledge of the software development
            pipeline which includes knowledge of methodologies/tools such as Git/GitHub, Trello/Jira, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban. I have applied
            this knowledge throughout personal projects and assignments throughout my education.<br />
            I have a strong passion of learning and programming, love to solve problems, and can adapt to new things very easily.
