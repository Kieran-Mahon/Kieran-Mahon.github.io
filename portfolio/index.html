                <td>
                    This project was my answer to my first assignment for my Algorithm Design & Analysis paper.
                    The assignment was about creating a networked program which uses a thread pool which processes
                    tasks. I decided to create a pixel drawing board which uses a server to pass information of
                    the board between clients. The project is on my GitHub (link to the right).

                    This project was my answer to my second assignment for my Algorithm Design & Analysis paper.
                    The assignment was about using three different methods (Brute Force, Greedy, Exact) to find
                    the highest profit for the division of a M by N piece of land. More information about the
                    working of each method is on the project page on my GitHub (link to the right).
