                <td>
                    This project was my answer to my first assignment for my Algorithm Design & Analysis paper.
                    The assignment was about creating a networked program which uses a thread pool which processes
                    tasks. I decided to create a pixel drawing board which uses a server to pass information of
                    the board between clients. The project is on my GitHub (link to the right).

                    This project was my answer to my second assignment for my Algorithm Design & Analysis paper.
                    The assignment was about using three different methods (Brute Force, Greedy, Exact) to find
                    the highest profit for the division of a M by N piece of land. More information about the
                    working of each method is on the project page on my GitHub (link to the right).

                    This project was my PDC (Program Design & Construction) paper's main project. It is a Java text
                    based game where the player has to move around a grid to get to the exit. There are enemies on
                    the way and items which you can pick up. If you walk into an enemy you must fight them. There
                    is a combat system, item collection system, saving system, and local leaderboard system. The
                    game can be found on my GitHub (link to the right).

                <td>
                    This project was my group project (myself with 3 others) for my Software Development Practices
                    paper. We designed and created a Unity timed escape game. The idea of the game is that you are
                    stuck on a ship which you are trying to get off as it has been hit by an asteroid. The game is
                    in 3D and uses a first-person controller. It also has multiple internal systems such as a
                    saving and loading system, settings system, holding system (can pick up, move, and drop objects),
                    time limit system, and different gravity system. The project was completed over a semester, and
                    we completed multiple sprints via Scrum. We planned and ran the whole project as if it was a
                    real development project.

                <td>
                    This was one of the first project I ever did. I learnt a lot from it, but it has a lot to
                    improve on such as switching to JavaScript objects and simplifying the code. This project
                    is a money clicker game built on Code.org using JavaScript. You are able to click the money
                    button to earn money then buy buildings and upgrades to make money quicker. Some of the
                    systems within the project include; a custom saving system, a customisation system (change
                    colours), and a reset and start again system.
